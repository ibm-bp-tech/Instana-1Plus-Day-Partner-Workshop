Instana provides the ability to define alert conditions for various scenarios from within the context of application perspective.At the end of this lab, you will be able to create a smart alert for calls with slow response time.\n\n## Step 1: \n\nClick Applications from left navigation. \n\nSearch for the robot shop application perspective you have created in earlier lab.\n\nClick on the ADD SMART ALERT at the bottom right corner of the robot-shop application perspective. \n\n## Step 2:\n\nAt ‘Step 1: Select Alert, select ‘Slow Calls’\n\n![Lab 11](../Labs/images/lab11.1.png) \n\nClick Next.\n\nAt ‘Step 2: Select Scope’, robot-shop (your application perspective) is pre-selected.\n\n![Lab 11](../Labs/images/lab11.2.png) \n\nClick Next. \n\nIn ‘Step 3: Alert Channels’, it asks to select an alert channel. We do not have any alert channels defined so we will just leave it blank. However you can create and specify an alert channel.\n\n![Lab 11](../Labs/images/lab11.3.png) \n\nClick Create.\n\n## Step 3:\n\nGo to ‘Smart Alerts’ tab in ‘robot-shop’ application perspective. You can enable/disable this alert any time just by using the pause/play button shown next to the alert.\n\n![Lab 11](../Labs/images/lab11.4.png) \n\n## Step 4:\n\nBy default this alert level is ‘warning’. Let us change this alert level to critical and create an incident in this scenario. \n\nClick on the three dots next to pause button and click on ‘Edit’.\n\nClick on ‘Properties’ and change alert level to critical and enable ‘Triggers Incident’. \n\nAlso update the description to have value 200 ms.\n\n![Lab 11](../Labs/images/lab11.5.png) \n\nWe want to specify the threshold value for condition violation. Let us define it as if 200 ms for 90th percentile. \n\nClick on ‘Threshold’ and change the values as shown.\n\n![Lab 11](../Labs/images/lab11.6.png)\n\nWe also want to define time threshold i.e. when do you want to be alerted. Lets us define as 5 minutes and number of consecutive occurrences as 3. Click on ‘Time Threshold’ and update the values as shown in the figure. \n\n![Lab 11](../Labs/images/lab11.7.png)\n\nClick on Save.\n\n## Step 5: \n\nWe have defined a smart alert for robot-shop application. If the condition specified in that alert violates, an incident would be created.\n\n![Lab 11](../Labs/images/lab11.8.png)\n\nClick on the issue shown and click on ‘view 1 issue’.\n\n![Lab 11](../Labs/images/lab11.9.png)\n\nThis will take you to the issue in Events view.\n\nGo to ‘Incidents’ tab and click on the active incident. It shows the time-series view of the incident, triggering event and related events.\n\n![Lab 11](../Labs/images/lab11.10.png)\n\nYou can expand any of the events and look further details and go to analyze calls. Let us expand the triggering event.\n\n![Lab 11](../Labs/images/lab11.11.png)\n\nClick on ‘Analyze Calls’ for the triggering event. \nIt will take you to Analytics view with filter conditions auto-applied based on the event/alert condition for the time duration when this event occurred.\n\n![Lab 11](../Labs/images/lab11.12.png)\n\nYou can further analyze the calls to understand the point of slowness. \n\n## Summary\n\nIn this lab we learnt how to create smart alert for the robot shop application for calls with slow response time. Instana provides the ability to define alert conditions for various scenarios from within the context of application perspective. \n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"a603de5f03b67b03ad058845f692398c","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":2194},"frontmatter":{"title":"Lab11"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Lab11\n---\nexport const Title = () => (\n  <span>\n    Lab 7 - Smart Alerts <br />\n  </span>\n);\n;\n\n## Lab Overview\n\nIn this lab we will create smart alert for the robot shop application.
