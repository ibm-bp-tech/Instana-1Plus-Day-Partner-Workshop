The Application Perspective (AP) auto-generates a feature rich monitoring dashboard where users can stay focused on the services they are interested in and not be distracted. AP’s can be customizable by technology, zone/cluster, version/release, and more. Alerts, errors, and logs are scoped to an AP to focus the troubleshooting.\n\n## Step 1:\n\nClick on the STAN icon\n\n![Lab 6](../Labs/images/6.1.png)\n\nFor the purposes of this lab, we will be utilizing the tags that we created in the previous labs. You will \nremember creating a tag called <Student=LAST NAME>. We will be utilizing this tag to create an Application Perspective.\n\n## Step 2:\n\nClick the New Application Perspective to create a new AP\n\n![Lab 6](../Labs/images/lab6.2.png)\n\n## Step 3:\n\nSelect Custom Tags.\n\nThen click Next.\n\n![Lab 6](../Labs/images/lab6.3.png)\n\n## Step 4:\n\nSelect Miscellaneous from the drop down.\n\nSelect Agent Tag. Select Student from the list of Tags. Select \"your last name\" from the list of values.\n\nPlease notice the preview that is displayed. This will give us validation that our filter is properly formatted.\n\nClick Next.\n\n![Lab 6](../Labs/images/lab6.4.png)\n\n## Step 5:\n\nName your AP Student \"your last name\"\n\nSelect All Calls.\n\nClick Create.\n\n![Lab 6](../Labs/images/lab6.5.png) \n\n## Step 6:\n\nValidate the new Application Perspective. It will take a minute or so before you see data populate the AP Dashboard.\n\nTo do this, start by clicking Application.\n\nMake sure to turn on Live mode.\n\nVerify that the new Application Perspective is listed.\n\n![Lab 6](../Labs/images/lab6.6.png)\n\n## Summary\n\nIn this lab we learnt how to create Application Perspective using custom tags and zones.
