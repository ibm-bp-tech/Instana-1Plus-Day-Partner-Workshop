For on-premises installations, Instana offers multiple options:\n\n- **Single Server** self-hosted is a _Containerized_ deployment that does not\n  support multi-tenancy. Self-Hosted is what Instana calls its on-premises\n  deployments. Of course, on-premises could be deployed into a public cloud, but\n  is not a recommended approach.\n- **Two server** _Containerized_ self-hosted configuration with the datastores\n  on one server and the other components on another. This option is also\n  single-tenant.\n- **Kubernetes deployment** with the cloud native backend components running in\n  a kubernetes cluster and the datastores running either distributed across\n  multiple servers or in the kubernetes cluster also. This configuration is\n  multi-tenant. \n\n### Tip\n\nOn-premises (self-hosted) releases are delivered every 4 weeks. The release have\nodd numbers such as 255, 257, 259, etc. When upgrading, you may upgrade from N-1\nor N-2, but you can't skip more than one release. So, you can upgrade from 255\nto 259, but not to 261. Even numbered releases are for SaaS only. SaaS is\nupgraded every 2 weeks.\n\nFor the installation of the Instana server, we'll be following the instructions\nfrom the Instana documentation for a **Self-Hosted Instana backend on Docker**.\nThe instructions can be found\n[here](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/instana-observability/current?topic=installer-installing-instana-backend-docker#installing-on-a-single-host)\nfor your reference, but you can follow the steps below. You will be performing\nan online installation, but Instana does support off-line (air-gapped) installs.\n\nThis _Self-Hosted Instana backend on Docker_ is Instana's smallest on-premises\ninstallation option. Production and larger deployments are installed into\nkubernetes for horizontal scale and resiliency. \n\n## 3.2: Prerequisites\n\nInstana requires a Linux server with 16 cores, 64 Gig of RAM and few hundred Gig\nof disk space for a POC sized deployment. Please refer [documentation](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/instana-observability/current?topic=requirements-instana-backend-docker#network-security-notes) for detailed pre-requisites. \n\nNormally, you would need to ensure that the virtual machine has the correct\nports opened in the firewall for the agent, UI, and EUM communications. For reference,\n[here are the ports](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/instana-observability/current?topic=requirements-instana-backend-docker#network-security-notes)\nthat need to be opened for the Instana Server for an on-prem deployment. \n\nUse the terminal to login to the Instana VM:\n\n```sh\nssh itzuser@<public ip of the host shared with you> -p 2223 -i <path to the key file>\n```\nWhen prompted if you want to continue connecting, type: `yes`\n\nUse sudo to become root.\n\n```sh\nsudo -i\n```\n\nPrior to installing Instana, you must install Docker CE or Docker EE. Run the\nfollowing commands to setup the prerequisites, download Docker CE, and install\nDocker CE on the virtual machine.\n\n```sh\napt-get install ca-certificates curl gnupg lsb-release -y\nmkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings\ncurl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg\necho   \"deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable\" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null\napt-get update -y\napt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-compose-plugin -y\n```\n\nAfter the commands have executed, verify that docker is installed and running.\nYou can run the `docker ps` command to confirm that it is installed and running.\n\n```sh\ndocker ps\n```\n\nIf docker is running, you should see output similar to what is shown below.\n\n![docker-ps](../Labs/images/docker-ps.png)\n\nNext, we want to pin the major version of Instana so that we don't get updates\nduring the lab. Issue the following command to pin the Instana version.\n\n#### NOTE: Be mindful when copying and pasting to ensure no extra lines are inserted by first copying the command to a text document.\n\n```sh\ncat >/etc/apt/preferences.d/instana-console <<EOF\nPackage: instana-console\nPin: version 266\nPin-Priority: 1000\nEOF\n```\n\nNext, create the following directories/filesystems that will be used for the\nInstana datastore storage.\n\nIdeally, these directories/filesystems should be setup on fast storage volumes\nwith a separate filesystem for each because the datastores are very I/O\nintensive. Even during a POC, these filesystems can become fairly large. \nProduction environments will be much larger and need to be planned for based on the size of the environment.\n\n```sh\nmkdir /mnt/metrics\nmkdir /mnt/traces\nmkdir /mnt/data\n```\n\nYou are now ready to start the installation of the Instana Server.\n\n---\n\n## 3.3: Installing Instana Server\n\nRun the following commands to install the Instana Server. These commands will\nvary depending on which Linux platform you are using for your installation. The\ninstructions below are for Ubuntu and Debian.\n\nBegin by installing the Instana package by issuing the following commands. Make\nsure the commands are successful before proceeding to the next step.\n\nThis will install the **instana** command on the server.\n\n```sh\nexport DOWNLOAD_KEY=<download_key>\n\necho 'deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/instana-archive-keyring.gpg] https://artifact-public.instana.io/artifactory/rel-debian-public-virtual generic main' > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/instana-product.list\ncat << EOF > /etc/apt/auth.conf\nmachine artifact-public.instana.io\n  login _\n  password $DOWNLOAD_KEY\nEOF\n\nwget -O- --user=_ --password=\"$DOWNLOAD_KEY\" https://artifact-public.instana.io/artifactory/api/security/keypair/public/repositories/rel-debian-public-virtual | gpg --dearmor > /usr/share/keyrings/instana-archive-keyring.gpg\n\napt-get update -y\napt-get install instana-console==265-0-1\napt-get clean\napt-get update\n```\n\nNow let's create the working directory for instana server installation:\n\n```sh\nmkdir -p /opt/instana && cd /opt/instana\n```\n\nNext, run the `instana init` command to install the Instana server. You will be\nprompted for additional information during the install.\n\n```sh\ninstana init\n```\nWhen you run the _init_ command, it generates a file named _settings.hcl_ in\nyour current directory. It is important to save this file. The settings.hcl file\ncontains the configuration settings for your deployment. It can be used to\nenable additional features and make other configuration settings in the future.\n\nYou will be prompted to select **single**, **dual-instana**, or\n**dual-clickhouse**. Type **Enter** to select **single**\n\n![](../Labs/images/single.png)\n\nNext, you will be prompted to enter a tenant name for your Instana server. This\ncan be any string. In a single server installation, the tenant name doesn't\nreally matter, but in multi-tenant or SaaS environment, the tenant name is very\nimportant because it becomes part of the URL to access the Instana server.\nCustomers frequently use their company name for the tenant.\n\n![](../Labs/images/tenant.png)\n\nNext, you will be prompted to enter a unit name. In a single server\ninstallation, the unit name doesn't really matter, but in multi-tenant or SaaS\nenvironment, the unit name is very important because it becomes part of the URL\nto access the Instana server. Customers frequently use a business unit or Dev,\nTest, Prod to identify the unit.\n\n![](../Labs/images/unit.png)\n\nYou will now be prompted for your **agent key**. Use the one provided by the Instructor.\n\n![](../Labs/images/agentKey.png)\n\nThe next step is to enter your **download key**. Use the same key as your\n**agent key** from the previous step.\n\n![](../Labs/images/downloadKey.png)\n\nNext, enter your **sales key**. Use the one provided by the Instructor.\n\n![](../Labs/images/salesKey.png)\n\nNext, you will be prompted for the fully qualified hostname of the server.\nNormally, you would enter a fully qualified hostname, but in this demo\nenvironment we will use the IP address.\n\n**Important** : Instead of specifying the hostname or fqdn, enter the **IP address** of the\nInstana server provided to you. \n\n![](../Labs/images/hostname.png)\n\nYou will now be prompted for the path where your data will be stored. The\ndefault path is **/mnt/data**. Press **Enter** to accept the default value.\n\n![](../Labs/images/data.png)\n\nYou will now be prompted for the path where your traces will be stored. The\ndefault path is **/mnt/traces**. Press **Enter** to accept the default value.\n\n![](../Labs/images/traces.png)\n\nNext, you will be prompted for the path where your metric data will be stored.\nThe default path is **/mnt/metrics**. Press **Enter** to accept the default\nvalue.\n\n![](../Labs/images/metrics.png)\n\nYou will be prompted for the location of the Instana logs. Press **Enter** to\naccept the default value of **/var/log/instana**.\n\n![](../Labs/images/logs.png)\n\nYou will be prompted for the path to your signed certificate file. If desired,\nyou can create your own. If you don't provide one, the installer will generate a\ncertificate. Press **Enter** and let Instana generate a self-signed certificate.\nIf you were deploying at a customer site and the customer wanted to use CA\nsigned certificates, this is the step where you would specify the existing\ncertificate.\n\n![](../Labs/images/certificate.png)\n\nFinally, you will be prompted for the private key file. For this lab, press\n**Enter** and have the install generate the key file for the self-signed\ncertificate.\n\n![](../Labs/images/key.png)\n\nInstana will now begin the installation process. It will take 20 to 30 minutes\nto complete the installation process.\n\n**Troubleshooting**\n\n- If there are any intermittent errors relating to containers being pulled or\n  starting you can run the `instana init` command again and resume the install\n  to try again.\n- If there are any errors relating to ports in use from a previous install\n  attempt, you can list the process listening on the port with\n  `lsof -t -i:<port-number>` and kill the process id returned with\n  `kill -9 <process-id>`\n\nAt the end of the installation, you will be shown the URL to access the Instana\nserver and a username of `admin@instana.local` and a **password**. Save this\ninformation so that you can use it later to login to the Instana user interface.\n\nThe output should look something like this:\n\n![](../Labs/images/install-success.png)\n\nBefore attempting to login to your Instana server, activate the license using\nthe steps in the following section.\n\n**Note**\n- If at any time you need to\n  [restart Instana](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/instana-observability/current?topic=installer-operations-docker-based-instana#stopping-all-components)\n  you can run the `instana stop` and `instana start` commands.\n\nChange the password for the administrator account **admin@instana.local** to\nsomething easier to remember for the labs:\n\n```sh\ninstana configure admin -p Passw0rd\n```\n\n## 3.4: Activate the license\n\nAfter completing the installation, you must activate the license. We suggest you\nrun the following commands in your working directory hence the license file will\nstore here:\n\n```sh\ncd /opt/instana\n```\n\nRun the following command to download the license:\n\n```sh\ninstana license download\n```\n\n![](../Labs/images/licenseDownload_opt_instana.png)\n\nNext, import the license to activate your license:\n\n```sh\ninstana license import\n```\n\n![](../Labs/images/licenseImport_opt_instana.png)\n\nYou can verify the license by typing:\n\n```sh\ninstana license verify\n```\n\n![](../Labs/images/licenseVerify_opt_instana.png)\n\n---\n\n## 3.5: Launch the Instana User interface\n\nYou are now ready to open a browser and login to the Instana user interface.\n\nYou can safely ignore the warning about the certificate being untrusted.\n\n![untrusted-cert-advance](../Labs/images/untrusted-cert-advance.png)\n\nWhen prompted, enter the username and password that you updated earlier.\n\n- Username: **admin@instana.local**\n- Password: **Passw0rd**\n\n![](../Labs/images/login.png)\n\nYou will be taken to an Initial Screen where you can install the instana agents\nor navigate to the main product UI. We will install an Instana Agent in the\nupcoming labs.\n\n![initial-instana-page](../Labs/images/initial-instana-page.png)\n\n---\n\n## 3.6: Turning on features and setting up SMTP\n\nFollowing the initial install of your Instana server, there are optional\nconfigurations that you will likely want to make.\n\n- You may need to setup the Instana server to use an SMTP server if you plan to\n  send out Email notifications.\n- There may be some optional features that you want to enable via feature flags.\n  Features such as VMware/vSphere monitoring, Power HMC monitoring, and zHMC\n  monitoring are disabled by default.\n\nFollow the steps below to configure the SMTP settings and enable some additional\nfeature flags.\n\n1. Edit `settings.hcl` file according to the\n   [documentation](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/instana-observability/current?topic=installer-enabling-optional-features).\n   The **settings.hcl** file will be located in the same directory where you\n   issued the **instana init** command.\n\nThese parameters are added to the settings.hcl file in the section with the\nother feature flags. Search in the settings.hcl file for **feature**. Then, add\nany additional feature flags that are desired in that section of the file. They\ncan be place anywhere within the **feature** section of the file.\n\n**Important** Be aware that turning on features (especially BETA features) may heavily impact\nbackend performance. DO NOT turn on features you don't need.\n\nAs we issued **instana init** from the working directory `/opt/instana`, the\n`settings.hcl` has been created there:\n\n```sh\ncd /opt/instana\n```\n\nBefore you edit the settings.hcl file, make a backup of the file by typing:\n\n```sh\ncp settings.hcl settings.hcl.bak\n```\n\nNow, edit the settings.hcl file by typing:\n\n```sh\nvi settings.hcl\n```\n\nLocate the existing _feature_ settings and add the following feature flags.\n\n```java\nfeature \"infraCustomDashboards\" {\n  enabled = true\n}\nfeature \"infraEntityExplore\" {\n  enabled = true\n}\n```\n\nNote: Review the other feature flags, <span\nstyle={{color: \"red\"}}> but do not modify into the settings.hcl file</span>.\n\nNext, in the same file search for the **smtp** section in the settings.hcl file.\nModify the smtp section as per the details shared by the Instructor. We recommend that you edit the\nparameters rather than copy/paste this section. It is easy to make a mistake\nwith the spacing when doing a copy/paste.\n\nIf you want, you can replace the **from** parameter with any Email address that\nyou like. The **from** Email address is what you will see as the sender of the\nEmail alerts from Instana.\n\n```sh\n  smtp {\n    from      = \"server@instana.com\"\n    host      = \"localhost\"\n    port      = 25\n    user      = \"jammer\"\n    password  = \"Passw0rd\"\n    use_ssl   = false\n    start_tls = false\n  }\n```\n\nSave the changes in the settings.hcl file.\n\n2. Apply the changes\n\n```sh\ninstana update -f ./settings.hcl\n```\n\nIt will take a little while for the configuration changes to take effect. The\nnext section on upgrading the Instana Server is for information only, you can\nread it while the configuration changes are being applied.\n\nOnce complete you should see the below\n\n![settings update](../Labs/images/settings-update.png)\n\n---\n\n## 3.7: Upgrading the Instana server\n\n<span\nstyle={{color: \"red\"}}> Do not perform these steps\n\nYou should not perform any steps in this section, it is for information only.\n\nWe want you to know the process for performing an upgrade.\n\n</span>\n\nBefore attempting to upgrade, you want to confirm your current version. Issue\nthe **instana version**\n\n```sh\ninstana version\n```\n\nNext, find out what versions are available to be installed. Issue the the\nfollowing command:\n\n```sh\napt-cache policy instana-console\n```\n\nYou will see a long list of versions that are available. Scroll to the top of\nthe list where you will see the most recent versions. ![](../Labs/images/versions.png)\n\nYou'll notice that in this example, 265-0-1 is the most recent version and 265-1-1\nis the current version. That means you can upgrade to that minor release. There\nis newer major release available.\n\n---\n\n## 3.8: Summary\n\nIn this portion of the lab, you have learned how to install a self-hosted docker\nbased Instana server. For a POC, we recommend either SaaS or the single server\nself-hosted docker installation of the Instana server. For production\ndeployments, customers will want the kubernetes based deployments to gain\nimproved scalability and resiliency.\n\nYou have also learned how to configure the SMTP settings and how to enable\nfeature flags.\n\nFinally, you learned how to upgrade a docker based self-hosted Instana server.\n\nYou are now ready to learn how to install and configure an Instana Agent.\n\n---\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"262e9b5e67c1118decb59b594fb7da75","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":1079},"frontmatter":{"title":"Lab1"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Lab1\n---\nexport const Title = () => (\n  <span>\n    Lab 0 - Instana Server Installation <br />\n  </span>\n);\n;\n\n# Instana Server Installation\n\n## 3.1: Introduction\n\nInstana backend is available as SaaS (preferred option) or self hosted (aka\non-prem).

You will be\nprompted for additional information during the install.\n\n```sh\ninstana init\n```\nWhen you run the _init_ command, it generates a file named _settings.hcl_ in\nyour current directory. It is important to save this file. The settings.hcl file\ncontains the configuration settings for your deployment. It can be used to\nenable additional features and make other configuration settings in the future.\n\nYou will be prompted to select **single**, **dual-instana**, or\n**dual-clickhouse**. Type **Enter** to select **single**\n\n![](../Labs/images/single.png)\n\nNext, you will be prompted to enter a tenant name for your Instana server. This\ncan be any string. In a single server installation, the tenant name doesn't\nreally matter, but in multi-tenant or SaaS environment, the tenant name is very\nimportant because it becomes part of the URL to access the Instana server.\nCustomers frequently use their company name for the tenant.\n\n![](../Labs/images/tenant.png)\n\nNext, you will be prompted to enter a unit name.

It will take 20 to 30 minutes\nto complete the installation process.\n\n**Troubleshooting**\n\n- If there are any intermittent errors relating to containers being pulled or\n  starting you can run the `instana init` command again and resume the install\n  to try again.\n- If there are any errors relating to ports in use from a previous install\n  attempt, you can list the process listening on the port with\n  `lsof -t -i:<port-number>` and kill the process id returned with\n  `kill -9 <process-id>`\n\nAt the end of the installation, you will be shown the URL to access the Instana\nserver and a username of `admin@instana.local` and a **password**. Save this\ninformation so that you can use it later to login to the Instana user interface.\n\nThe output should look something like this:\n\n![](../Labs/images/install-success.png)\n\nBefore attempting to login to your Instana server, activate the license using\nthe steps in the following section.\n\n**Note**\n- If at any time you need to\n  [restart Instana](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/instana-observability/current?topic=installer-operations-docker-based-instana#stopping-all-components)\n  you can run the `instana stop` and `instana start` commands.\n\nChange the password for the administrator account **admin@instana.local** to\nsomething easier to remember for the labs:\n\n```sh\ninstana configure admin -p Passw0rd\n```\n\n## 3.4: Activate the license\n\nAfter completing the installation, you must activate the license. We suggest you\nrun the following commands in your working directory hence the license file will\nstore here:\n\n```sh\ncd /opt/instana\n```\n\nRun the following command to download the license:\n\n```sh\ninstana license download\n```\n\n![](../Labs/images/licenseDownload_opt_instana.png)\n\nNext, import the license to activate your license:\n\n```sh\ninstana license import\n```\n\n![](../Labs/images/licenseImport_opt_instana.png)\n\nYou can verify the license by typing:\n\n```sh\ninstana license verify\n```\n\n![](../Labs/images/licenseVerify_opt_instana.png)\n\n---\n\n## 3.5: Launch the Instana User interface\n\nYou are now ready to open a browser and login to the Instana user interface.\n\nYou can safely ignore the warning about the certificate being untrusted.\n\n![untrusted-cert-advance](../Labs/images/untrusted-cert-advance.png)\n\nWhen prompted, enter the username and password that you updated earlier.\n\n- Username: **admin@instana.local**\n- Password: **Passw0rd**\n\n![](../Labs/images/login.png)\n\nYou will be taken to an Initial Screen where you can install the instana agents\nor navigate to the main product UI. We will install an Instana Agent in the\nupcoming labs.\n\n![initial-instana-page](../Labs/images/initial-instana-page.png)\n\n---\n\n## 3.6: Turning on features and setting up SMTP\n\nFollowing the initial install of your Instana server, there are optional\nconfigurations that you will likely want to make.\n\n- You may need to setup the Instana server to use an SMTP server if you plan to\n  send out Email notifications.\n- There may be some optional features that you want to enable via feature flags.\n  Features such as VMware/vSphere monitoring, Power HMC monitoring, and zHMC\n  monitoring are disabled by default.\n\nFollow the steps below to configure the SMTP settings and enable some additional\nfeature flags.\n\n1. Edit `settings.hcl` file according to the\n   [documentation](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/instana-observability/current?topic=installer-enabling-optional-features).\n   The **settings.hcl** file will be located in the same directory where you\n   issued the **instana init** command.\n\nThese parameters are added to the settings.hcl file in the section with the\nother feature flags. Search in the settings.hcl file for **feature**. Then, add\nany additional feature flags that are desired in that section of the file. They\ncan be place anywhere within the **feature** section of the file.\n\n**Important** Be aware that turning on features (especially BETA features) may heavily impact\nbackend performance. DO NOT turn on features you don't need.\n\nAs we issued **instana init** from the working directory `/opt/instana`, the\n`settings.hcl` has been created there:\n\n```sh\ncd /opt/instana\n```\n\nBefore you edit the settings.hcl file, make a backup of the file by typing:\n\n```sh\ncp settings.hcl settings.hcl.bak\n```\n\nNow, edit the settings.hcl file by typing:\n\n```sh\nvi settings.hcl\n```\n\nLocate the existing _feature_ settings and add the following feature flags.\n\n```java\nfeature \"infraCustomDashboards\" {\n  enabled = true\n}\nfeature \"infraEntityExplore\" {\n  enabled = true\n}\n```\n\nNote: Review the other feature flags, <span\nstyle={{color: \"red\"}}> but do not modify into the settings.hcl file</span>.\n\nNext, in the same file search for the **smtp** section in the settings.hcl file.\nModify the smtp section as per the details shared by the Instructor. We recommend that you edit the\nparameters rather than copy/paste this section. It is easy to make a mistake\nwith the spacing when doing a copy/paste.\n\nIf you want, you can replace the **from** parameter with any Email address that\nyou like. The **from** Email address is what you will see as the sender of the\nEmail alerts from Instana.\n\n```sh\n  smtp {\n    from      = \"server@instana.com\"\n    host      = \"localhost\"\n    port      = 25\n    user      = \"jammer\"\n    password  = \"Passw0rd\"\n    use_ssl   = false\n    start_tls = false\n  }\n```\n\nSave the changes in the settings.hcl file.\n\n2. Apply the changes\n\n```sh\ninstana update -f ./settings.hcl\n```\n\nIt will take a little while for the configuration changes to take effect. The\nnext section on upgrading the Instana Server is for information only, you can\nread it while the configuration changes are being applied.\n\nOnce complete you should see the below\n\n![settings update](../Labs/images/settings-update.png)\n\n---\n\n## 3.7: Upgrading the Instana server\n\n<span\nstyle={{color: \"red\"}}> Do not perform these steps\n\nYou should not perform any steps in this section, it is for information only.\n\nWe want you to know the process for performing an upgrade.\n\n</span>\n\nBefore attempting to upgrade, you want to confirm your current version. Issue\nthe **instana version**\n\n```sh\ninstana version\n```\n\nNext, find out what versions are available to be installed. Issue the the\nfollowing command:\n\n```sh\napt-cache policy instana-console\n```\n\nYou will see a long list of versions that are available. Scroll to the top of\nthe list where you will see the most recent versions. ![](../Labs/images/versions.png)\n\nYou'll notice that in this example, 265-0-1 is the most recent version and 265-1-1\nis the current version. That means you can upgrade to that minor release. There\nis newer major release available.\n\n---\n\n## 3.8: Summary\n\nIn this portion of the lab, you have learned how to install a self-hosted docker\nbased Instana server. For a POC, we recommend either SaaS or the single server\nself-hosted docker installation of the Instana server. For production\ndeployments, customers will want the kubernetes based deployments to gain\nimproved scalability and resiliency.\n\nYou have also learned how to configure the SMTP settings and how to enable\nfeature flags.\n\nFinally, you learned how to upgrade a docker based self-hosted Instana server.\n\nYou are now ready to learn how to install and configure an Instana Agent.\n\n---\n","fileAbsolutePath":"/Users/brandonwu/Documents/PTS/Gatsby/Instana-1Plus-Day-Partner-Workshop/src/pages/Labs_Server_Agent_Install/Lab0.mdx"}}},
