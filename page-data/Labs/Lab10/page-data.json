Instana supports website monitoring by analyzing actual browser request and loading times. It allows detailed insights into the web browsing experience of users, and deep visibility into application call paths. At the end of this lab, you will be able to analyse website monitoring for the sample application.\n\n## Step 1: \n\nClick Websites & Mobile Apps from left navigation. \n\nThen click Add Website. \n\nGive a unique name for your website and click Add Website button.\n\n![Lab 10](images/lab10.5.png)\n\nTake a note of reporting url and eum key as shown below:\n\n![Lab 10](images/lab10.4.png) \n\n## Step 2:\n\nSSH into the host that was provided by your instructor, and browse to the installation directory for Robot Shop \n\n```\ncd /home/ubuntu/robot-shop\n\n```\n\n## Step 3:\n\nIn your terminal window type to enable end user monitoring for this application\n\n```\nvi docker-compose.yaml \n```\n\nUncomment and update the reporting url and eum key noted in step 1 as shown below.\n\n![Lab 10](images/lab10.2.png) \n\nSave the yaml file.\n\n## Step 4:\n\nIn your terminal window type \n\n```\ndocker-compose up -d\n```\n\nNote: -d runs it in the background\n\nValidate that Stan’s Robot Shop is up by going to:\n\nhttp://(publicip):8080\n\n## Step 5: \n\nTry to refresh the page http://(publicip):8080 multiple times and browse through the site.\n\nThen go to Instana UI and click on Websites & Mobile Apps.\n\nSearch for your website and analyse various statistics.\n\n![Lab 10](images/lab10.3.png)","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"ea251d36b4556933ab6cbd2dfe61c57e","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":223},"frontmatter":{"title":"Lab10"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Lab10\n---\nexport const Title = () => (\n  <span>\n    Lab 10 - End User Monitoring <br />\n  </span>\n);\n;\n\n## Lab Overview\n\nIn this lab we will explore End-User Monitoring (EUM), or Real-User Monitoring (RUM) for the robot shop application.
