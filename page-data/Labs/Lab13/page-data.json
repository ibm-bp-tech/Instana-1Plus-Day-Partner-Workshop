While Instana provides comprehensive dashboards to support common use-cases, there can be situations where a custom dashboard needs to be created.\n\nThere are three options for custom dashboarding with Instana:\n1.\tBuild native custom dashboards from directly within Instana (will be covered in this lab).\n2.\tLeverage Instana's Grafana plugin when you'd like to combine Instana data with other data sources.\n3.\tLeverage Instana REST API and build dashboards in the tool of your choice for complete flexibility.\n\n## Step 1: \n\nClick the Instana icon, it will show the default dashboard. \n\nClick the dropdown and we can click the \"Create Dashboard\" button to start:\n\n![Lab 13](images/lab13.1.png) \n\nIn the prompt, let’s give it a name say \"your name SLO Monitoring\", and click \"Create\":\n \nYou will be redirected to the newly created dashboard, which is blank now.\n\n![Lab 13](images/lab13.2.png) \n\n## Step 2:\n\nClick \"Add Widget\" to add a new widget to the dashboard. \n\nThere are couple of widget types to choose from, lets select \"SLO\" widget. \n\n![Lab 13](images/lab13.3.png) \n\nClick Next.\n\n![Lab 13](images/lab13.4.png) \n\nSelect your application perspective from the dropdown.\n\nYou may not have a predefined SLI yet, so click \"Manage SLIs\" button to create one:\n\nLet’s define a \"Service Latency\" SLI with:\nSLI Customization:\n-\tName: Service Latency - Catalogue Service\n-\tType: Time-based\nSLI Entity:\n-\tBoundary: Inbound Calls\n-\tService: catalogue\n-\tEndpoint: All Endpoints\nMetric and Threshold:\n-\tMetric: Latency\n-\tAggregation: 95th\n-\tThreshold (ms): 200\n\n![Lab 13](images/lab13.5.png) \n![Lab 13](images/lab13.6.png) \n\nClick \"Create\" button to create it and go back to our widget configuration page.\n\nSLO Configuration:\n-\tApplication Perspective: your AP’s name\n-\tService Level Indicator: the one you just created, e.g. Service Latency - Catalogue Service\n-\tSLO Target: 99 %\n-\tTime Window: Dynamic time window\nWidget Name:\n-\tName: SLO your name - Catalogue Service\n\nThere is a good preview for how the SLO will look like. \n\n![Lab 13](images/lab13.7.png) \n\nClick \"Create\" button to create this SLO widget.\n\nDo remember to click the \"Save changes\" to save it.\n\n## Step 3:\n\nLets add another event based widget.\n\nLet’s quickly go through these steps to add an event-based widget:\n \n![Lab 13](images/lab13.3.png) \n\nNow let’s create the SLI with:\nSLI Customization:\n-\tName: Event SLI - Your Robot Shop\n-\tType: Event-based\nSLI Entity:\n-\tBoundary: Inbound Calls\nGood Events:\n-\tCall Erroneous is false\nBad Events:\n-\tCall Erroneous is true OR Call Latency >=5000\n\n![Lab 13](images/lab13.8.png) \n![Lab 13](images/lab13.9.png) \n\nClick Create and return to the SLO configuration page.\n\nMake sure the newly created SLI is selected in the dropdown.\n\nLet’s configure the widget as below:\nSLO Configuration:\n-\tApplication Perspective: your AP’s name\n-\tService Level Indicator: the one you just created, e.g. Event SLI - Your Robot Shop\n-\tSLO Target: 95 %\n-\tTime Window: Dynamic time window\nWidget Name:\n-\tName: SLO – Your name Robot Shop Events\n\n![Lab 13](images/lab13.10.png) \n\nClick Create button and return to the dashboard view.\n\nNote: you may hover over the widget and some buttons will be appeared, by which we can move, edit, duplicate, delete the widget.\n\nRe-position the widget via dragging as below:\n\n![Lab 13](images/lab13.11.png) \n\nClick \"Save changes\".\n\n## Step 4:\n\nOnce clicked the \"…\" button on top right, there are more options:\n-\tTV Mode: This is to become \"full screen\" so it’s perfect to project it to TV.\n-\tMake Default: Make this dashboard as default in the landing page after login. \n-\tEdit Name: This is to edit the dashboard name\n-\tEdit As JSON: This is to edit the dashboard in JSON format – this is cool especially when we’re editing some metric numbers.\n-\tDuplicate: This is to duplicate the dashboard.\n-\tDelete: This is to delete the dashboard.\n\n![Lab 13](images/lab13.12.png) \n \nAnd by default, the custom dashboards are private, which means that only the author can see them. \nWe can click the \"Share\" button to make it public based on the user permissions.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n ","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"8a626525be8ed58e2f65fca6b7589d1f","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":578},"frontmatter":{"title":"Lab13"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Lab13\n---\nexport const Title = () => (\n  <span>\n    Lab 13 - Custom Dashboards <br />\n  </span>\n);\n;\n\n## Lab Overview\n\nIn this lab we will create custom dashboard from directly within Instana, to cover the needs of building an SLO (service-level objective) oriented dashboard.
